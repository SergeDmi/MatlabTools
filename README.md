# MatlabTools
A collection of convenient tools for Matlab. Coded and added randomly.
Developed by S. Dmitrieff. www.biophysics.fr

## Statistics
For now indudes :  
- ortho_robust_fit : a procedure to fit a set of points by a line using robust orthogonal fitting  
- multidim_regression : a multi-dimensional linear regression tool (singe observable predicted by several parameters)  
And the bootstraping methods built around those.

TODO :  
An orthogonal fitter for multi-dimensional data, based on PCA. First step is a N-dim cross product. Works !
